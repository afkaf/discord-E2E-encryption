# discord-E2E-encryption
A discord self-bot client for sending encrypted messages with asymmetric encryption. This is a semi-functional work in progress.

The password value for storing your private key is still hardcoded until I come up with a better storage solution. If you want to use it now, just replace that line with an input statement and enter your own password. This storage method for the private key is not ideal, but better than nothing for now.
